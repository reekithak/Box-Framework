# ***Box-Framework-Automation***


The Repository contains (Partial - Sample & Worked out) Codes of the project "Box Framework".
Box Framwork is a Data Analytics based project (Automation Framework for a data-analytics pipeline) , that i worked on during my internship period at Positive Integers. The project uses Data Analytics use-cases to form boxes (Sets / Containers) of 
products that can be sold into the open markets.

I've uploaded the code and methodolgies along with the intense logic that has been used in the project . The Required runtime is around 5 mins for a "Typically" Huge Dataset.
The project takes into account by usage of various py-libraries such as (numpy,pandas,matplotlib,math etc ).

The entire code hasn't been uploaded & is not ready to "run in a click" , and is partially available for viewing purpose.
