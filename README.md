# Box-Framework-Automation

## NOTE:- The Project is not open and also isnt the data.

## What the project is about
The Repository contains (Partial & Worked out) Codes of the project "Box Framework".

### What is a Box ?
- The Box here represents a set of items in simple terms

### More about the Box?
- The Box is set of items, infact the top items along with their kind of stores to sell into, what amount, what location, what time of the year.
- Box Framwork is a Data Analytics based project (Automation Framework for a data-analytics pipeline) , that i worked on during my internship period at Positive Integers. The project uses Data Analytics use-cases to form boxes (Sets / Containers) of products that can be sold into the open markets.

### Client & Outcome ?
- The client i worked for was [colgate palmolive](https://www.colgatepalmolive.com/en-us)
- This was one of the main projects.
- We had to build 3 types of boxes (Lower,Medium,Higher)
- The Lower was to be sold to small stores and Medium to okayish and better business and Higher ones to big markets and stores.
- The project data is private hence only parts of the outcome is visible in the Notebooks.

### Platform, No Script ?
- Since its a data Analytics project, it was mandatory to use Jupyter Notebooks for analysis and work based on it.
- Scripts wasn't really needed, when everything could be done within a notebook.
- The final file was made into a script, when given the exact files processes and saves the boxes as per need.
- This project was client specific, hence we expected same kind of files and data everytime it was to be run ( as per the instructions given ).

I've uploaded the code and methodolgies along with the intense logic that has been used in the project . The Required runtime is around 5 mins for a "Typically" Huge Dataset.
The project takes into account by usage of various py-libraries such as (numpy,pandas,matplotlib,math etc ).

The entire code hasn't been uploaded & is not ready to "run in a click" , and is partially available for viewing purpose. 

***NOTE :- The data used here is private and its against the rule for public use , hence I've made sure that its not openly available / visible to visitors***
